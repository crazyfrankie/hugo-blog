This article explores the design concepts and implementation approaches of decentralized systems from the perspective of log processing.

## Overview of Decentralized Systems

Decentralization is an important concept in distributed system design. It improves system reliability and fault tolerance by distributing control across multiple nodes.

In traditional centralized systems, all requests must be processed through a central server, creating a single point of failure. Decentralized systems work through multiple nodes collaborating together, so the system can continue to operate even if some nodes fail.

## The Role of Log Processing in Decentralization

Log processing is a key component in decentralized systems. It is responsible for recording and synchronizing state changes across nodes, ensuring data consistency and traceability.
