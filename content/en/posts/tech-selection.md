# Core Principles
Start with the data.

What does this mean? Often, before transitioning to enterprise-level development, we consider a feature "complete" once it's implemented and tested. But for an enterprise project, coding is just the beginning.

Because an API isn't guaranteed to remain functional just because it passed initial tests. Continuous monitoring is essentialâ€”tracking success and failure rates, and modifying code based on business tolerance thresholds for these metrics.

Therefore, when selecting technologies, we must consider not only initial demo implementation and workflow validation but also whether the solution offers maintainability, scalability, and the ability to meet evolving data demands.
